## Project Description: 

This is a small implementation of Wile E. Coyote and the Road Runner cartoons by Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies.

It allows user to move Road Runner accross a map from a starting point to a goal, by trying to hit as few obstacles as possible.

It also has 'Mind Its Own' state, which uses 3 graph algorithms to find a path from start to end. Those algorithms are: A*, Dijkstra, and Depth First Search.

## Get started:
- Clone the repository to your local machine
- Make sure you have these installed:

  -Java 8 or later version
  
  -JavaFX
  
- Open you project directory and open src/UI/Main.java
- Play Manually or use on of pre build algorithms to solve the game.
- Have fun!
